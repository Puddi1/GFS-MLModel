# GFS MLModel

GFS MLModel is a stack to build, traind and test one or multiple Machine Learning models with a docker container as quickly as possible.  
It provides a lot of boilerplate code to help you develop and deploy to production your models.  
The stack runs models in the backend and provides, through Flask, a very efficient and robust API to use and monitor your models.  
Perfect match if you use the GFS-Stack.
